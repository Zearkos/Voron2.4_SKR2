Summary of Changes:

SKR2_Config.cfg
Original file was "Voron2_SKR_14_Config.cfg" (https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2/blob/Voron2.4/firmware/klipper_configurations/SKR_1.4/Voron2_SKR_14_Config.cfg)
	1: Remapped all pins to new naming convention on SKR2 board.  				Lines: Multiple
	2: Added [output_pin motor_power] and a multi-pin named "output_power"  	Lines: 95-100
		- [output_pin motor_power] only allows for one pin to be listed, but both boards must have power applied or UART will fail.  Multi-pin solves issue without over-complicating the fix.
	
SKR2 (Rev B) Wiring Diagram.pdf
Mimic'd file "Voron2_SKR_14_Wiring.pdf"
	1: Generated new diagrams using SKR2 board image.
	2: Added Board Revision check and Addendum A with reference images of MOSFETs.
		- Don't use the REV A boards.  The workaround is annoying, and users are better off returning their boards to the vendor.
	3: Added green "Install Jumpers" box around "U disk/RRF Wifi" jumper pad. 
		- Tested with jumpers in both positions, no change in activation or features for Klipper. 
	4: Added stepper driver diagrams, with guidance to NOT cut diag pins.
		- Sensorless homing now requires a jumper on the pins to the side of the diag pin.  Jumper not installed, no need to cut pin.
	5: Moved Probe Power pins on Z board from FAN2 from SKR 1.4 to FAN3 on SKR2.
		- No Activation Pin required in Firmware to power the Probe with this change.  Probe will always receive 24v (if board powered by 24V)
